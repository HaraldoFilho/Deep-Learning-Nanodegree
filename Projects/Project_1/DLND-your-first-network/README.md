#  Your first neural network

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 1**

In this project we had to build a Neural Network from scratch and apply it on a real problem: predict the number of future bike rentals after analyzing a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) containing information about a period of two years of rentals. The project was written in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_,  _matplotlib_ and _pandas_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment.
