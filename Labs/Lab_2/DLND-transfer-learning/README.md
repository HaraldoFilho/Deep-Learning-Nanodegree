### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Exercise**

In this exercise we had to build an image classifier RNN using the [_transfer learning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_transfer) technique with [VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) trained on the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/) to classify images of flowers.
