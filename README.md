## Projects

### Project 1: [Your first neural network](Projects/Project_1/DLND-your-first-network)

In this project we had to build a neural network from scratch and apply it on a real problem: predict the number of future bike rentals after analyzing a dataset containing information about a period of two years of rentals.

### Project 2: [Image Classification](Projects/Project_2/DLND-image-classification)

In this project we had to build a convolutional neural network using _TensorFlow_ and use it to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Project 3: [Generate TV Scripts](Projects/Project_3/DLND-tv-script-generation)

In this project we had to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using _TensorFlow_ and use it to generate a new Simpsons TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons.

### Project 4: [Translate a Language](Projects/Project_4/DLND-language-translation)

In this project we had to build a Sequence to Sequence model that can translate new sentences from English to French and train it on a dataset of English and French sentences.

### Project 5: [Generate Faces](Projects/Project_5/DLND-face-generation)

In this project we had to build a Generative Adversarial Network that can generate novel faces when trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA).

## Labs

Exercises with topics not covered on the projects

### Lab 1: [Autoencoders](Labs/Lab_1/DLND-autoencoder)

In this exercise we had to implement autoencoder models and use them on examples of data compression and image denoising.

### Lab 2: [Transfer Learning](Labs/Lab_2/DLND-transfer-learning)

In this exercise we had to build an image classifier RNN using the transfer learning technique with VGGNet trained on the ImageNet dataset to classify images of flowers.
